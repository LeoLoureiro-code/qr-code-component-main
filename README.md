## Overview

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project I practice a little more about flexbox and center element using it.


### Continued development

In future projects I want to focus more in creating more complex web desing. Adding difficulty will help me to make a better use of flexbox characteristics.
